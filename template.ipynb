    "### Choice of dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I analyze major outage events witnessed in the continental US from January 2000 to July 2016, where a \"major outage\" refers to an outage that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused a firm load loss of 300 MW. In addition to the outages' characteristics, the dataset also contains information regarding regional climate information, land-use, electricity consumption patterns, and economic characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "I chose this dataset because it yields itself to interesting analysis on variables that predict outage, especially considering the diversity and amount of geographic, climate, and economic information available. Furthermore, the dataset itself is important due to the **real world consequences** of power outages - these events have major societal impact and affect key infrastructure, including hospitals, transport systems, communication networks, etc. Working with this dataset allows us to do important data analysis on the causes of these events, and inform policymaking and mitigation strategies in order to product cities and homes from major power outages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions brainstorm and selection\n",
    "\n",
    "While looking at the dataset, I thought of the following questions that I could analyze:\n",
    "1. What is the background regional and climate information (i.e. the environment) of major power outages of varying severity and cause?\n",
    "2. How do socioeconomic conditions of the region affect the severity of outages as measured by the duration and number of people affected?\n",
    "3. Is there a distinct geographic association with coastal regions and power outage cause and/or severity? What background characteristics play into the distinction?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I ultimately chose to go with the first question: \n",
    "**What is the background regional and climate information (i.e. the environment) of major power outages of varying severity and cause?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I plan to look into how various features that can affect regional climate (such as the geographic region, the month the outage occurred, the presence of a hurricane, etc.) play into the impact characteristics of outages, focusing on outage duration and the cause category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons why this question is important:\n",
    "1. Different climate patterns can strongly influence storm severity, equipment stress, grid load, etc. and can be key preidctors about whether an area is affected by a major power outage.\n",
    "2. Climate change sees an increased variance of climate events - being able to predict power outages quickly before they happened can be important to save infrastucture in times of climate disaster (ex. hurricanes or major storms).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description of key columns and overall shape of dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **1534 rows** in the dataset, indicating the presence of 1534 major outage events that occurred in the time period of the study, of which we find the following features relevant:\n",

    "I took the following steps to clean my data. Note that in this step, I DID NOT impute `NaN` values, as those will be important for future missingness analysis:\n",
    "1. Set the index of the dataset using a unique identifier `OBS` instead of sticking with the default sequence. This allowed for a cleaner dataset that did not have a duplicate index variable, preventing its inclusion in exploratory data analysis (as it would just be a static range) or predictions.\n",
    "2. Perform datetime conversions. There seem to be separate columns for the calendar date and the time - combining these would make future analysis easier, and converting to datetime would allow for them to become quantitative discrete variables that I can use in future analysis if I choose to. Specifically, I combine `OUTAGE.START.DATE` and `OUTAGE.START.TIME` and `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE` and `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME` and convert them using `pd.to_datetime()`\n",
    "3. Drop any unnecessary and/or redundant columns. Although in Steps 3-8 I am already filtering for the columns that I want, this will make my data cleaner and more easily perform the univariate and bi-variate analysis of this step. The columns I drop are `OUTAGE.START.TIME`, `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME`, and `U.S._STATE`. \n",
    "   - I drop `OUTAGE.START.TIME` and `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME` because their data has already been included into `OUTAGE.START.DATE` and `OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE`\n",
    "   - I drop `U.S._STATE` because it contains the same information as `POSTAL.CODE`\n",
    "   - Note that although I am looking at specifically climate and regional information, I don't drop any more columns. This is because in the case that my research question changes further along in the project to account for economic factors (for example, in Step 8), I want the freedom to access these values.\n",
    "4. I replace 0 values in the columns that I am using to look at my impact with `NaN`. These include `CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED` and `DEMAND.LOSS.MW`. This is because in the data specifications, we know that the amount of customers affected is at least 50,000 and the demand lost is at least 300 MW.\n",
    "    - I do not replace 0 values in `OUTAGE.DURATION`. Although it is unlikely that a major outage event lasts 0 minutes there is no indication that this is a requirement for the dataset, and it is possible that power was restored immediately. "

    "From here, I need to perform univariate and bivariate analysis. I wanted to create general functions to plot and save graphs and grab relevant ones in the notebook when I needed to. I defined the following functions:\n",
    "1. `plot_against_categorical_var` plots a boxplot of a categorical variables (such as the U.S. climate region) against a numerical metric (such as the outage duration).\n",
    "2. `plot_against_numerical_var` plots a scatter plot of a numerical variable (such as the anomaly level of El Nino or La Nina) against another numerical metric (such as the amount of customers affected).\n",
    "3. `plot_bivariate` uses the basis that the above two functions formed to create a figure with three subplots (and therefore perform an all-encompassing bivariate analysis) for a specified column in the dataset. Specifically, as defined in the problem statement above, I want to see how various climate-based factors affect outage impact factors, so for each column, I made a subplot comparing it to outage duration, demand loss (in Megawatts), and the customers affected.\n",
    "4. `plot_univariate` plots a univariate analysis of a column - if the data was categorical (such as the U.S. climate region), a histogram was plotted to demonstrate the category density. If the data was numerical, then the Seaborn library was used in conjunction with Matplotlib to create a KDE plot.\n",
    "5. `save_figure` saves an image to a folder for easy access and usage.\n",
    "6. `save_combined_univariate` plots a univariate analysis of all of the column in the dataset and creates a figure with all of them at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a lot of these graphs, I noticed that outlier values, especially those in the impact metrics, were making the values difficult to interpret. Therefore, even though I did not remove them from the data, for the purpose of understanding the patterns present in the data better, I included an `exclude_top_pct` variable. Please note that this DOES NOT impact any future analysis, all it does is reveal patterns in graphs that would normally just look like uninterpretable lines with a few plotted outliers."

However, unlike the climate region, we cannot be quick to assume that regional/climate characteristics cause this. It is more likely that the \"normal\" climate category encompasses a much larger portion of the years studied because the average year **is** normal.\n",

    "2. I am choosing **accuracy** as the classification metric over precision, recall, or F1-score:\n",
    "   1. While severe weather outages are more common, precision and recall are primarily meaningful in binary classification or when some classes are more critical. Here, all outage causes are equally important, and we want to correctly identify the cause regardless of class.\n",
    "   2. In multiclass classification, each instance belongs to only one class. Prioritizing precision for one class reduces false positives for that class but increases false negatives for it, which in turn increases false positives for other classes. Similarly, prioritizing recall for one class reduces its false negatives but increases its false positives, shifting errors to other classes. Therefore, precision and recall metrics are difficult to interpret in this zero-sum scenario.\n",

    "3. The **response variable** I am using is the cause category, as it directly aligns with my research problem on investigating outage information (such as cause and severity) using regional/climate information. Furthermore, since causes of outages are discrete and mutually exclusive, it lends itself to a classification problem.\n",

    "1. I applied a `StandardScaler` on my quantitative columns. Although this does not specifically help with model accuracy or changes how decisions are made, it does make the model more interpretable.\n",
    "2. I removed columns that are highly correlated to reduce model multicollinarity. The column that this was relevant to was `PCT_WATER_TOT` and `PCT_LAND`, as you could calculate `PCT_WATER_TOT = 1 - PCT_LAND`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In terms of new features, I added the following:\n",
    "1. I **binarized** the `HURRICANE.NAMES` column to be `HURRICANE_PRESENT`. This is because a) imputing `NaN` values with randomly selected hurricane names is misrepresentative of the climate conditions leading up to the power outage and b) the presence or absence of a hurricane is a relevant piece of data that can be used to predict the cause of an outage, especially considering its impact on climate data at that specific time point.\n",
    "2. I **mapped** the quantitative column of `MONTH` to a categorical column of `SEASON`. This is because a) encoding the `SEASON` as opposed to `MONTH` allows for better generalization to make our predictions (i.e. whether a month is June, July, or August might be less relevant than the fact that these are summer months and therefore have specific climate characteristics) and b) numerically far months (like December and January) are able to be categorically adjacent to one another and therefore more representative of climate patterns.\n",
    "   \n",
    "From there, I tested a second model (**Random Forest**) and used **GridSearchCV** with both models in order to determine the best-performing model and set of hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Decision Tree** model, I made sure to optimize for the following hyperparameters:\n",
    "1. `max_depth`: this controls the maximum depth of the tree, and I hope to prevent overfitting by limiting it and finding the optimal depth for maximum accuracy.\n",
    "2. `min_samples_split`: this controls the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, and I hope to prevent overfitting by requiring a higher number of samples to make splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Random Forest** model, I made sure to optimize for the same hyperparameters as the decision tree plus one more:\n",
    "1. `n_estimators`: this controls how MANY decision trees I am using to make the general decision. If I have too few, it can lead to unstable predictions, but too many can lead to unnecessary computation and no gain."
